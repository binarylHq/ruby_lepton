# Ruby Lepton
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ruby_lepton.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ruby_lepton)

## Description
A Ruby wrapper library for Dropbox JPEG Lepton compression tool.

## Getting started
Install Dropbox Lepton

On macOS with Homebrew:
 ```
 brew install lepton
 ```
On linux:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lepton
```
**This guide assumes you have Dropbox Lepton installed.**

## Installation

```
gem install ruby_lepton
```
or include inside Gemfile
```
gem "ruby_lepton"
```
Install ruby lepton:

    $ bundle exec ruby_lepton install

## Usage

Compress method
```
RubyLepton::Base.compress(path_to_source_file, options)
```
Decompress method
```
RubyLepton::Base.decompress(path_to_source_file, options)
```
`options` can be passed as hash `{binary: true}`

Supported options:
`binary`

## Usage CLI

Generate binstubs for CLI commands:

`bundle binstubs ruby_lepton`

`ruby_lepton` executable will be generated  under `bin/` folder


To compress a file:
```
$ bundle exec ruby_lepton compress [PATH] [OPTIONS]
```
To decompress a file:
```
$ bundle exec ruby_lepton decompress [PATH] [OPTIONS]
```

#### Options
```
$ bundle exec ruby_lepton compress path_to_file --verbose --binary
$ bundle exec ruby_lepton decompress path_to_file --no-verbose --no-binary
```
or you can pass alias for binary
```
$ bundle exec ruby_lepton compress path_to_file -b
$ bundle exec ruby_lepton decompress path_to_file -b
```
## Output

#### File generation
By default, file is generated for compression and decompression under `output/` folder

#### Binary data
Binary data will be returned instead of file by passing `--binary` option
```
$ bundle exec ruby_lepton compress path_to_file --binary
```

File is not generated when `--binary` option is passed


## Development
